RustFest Barcelona 2019 was the first time I attended a Rust conference. I've previously been to a few editions of DrupalCon as well as React.Amsterdam so I have something to compare the experience with. However, RustFest was a unique experience compared to the previous conferences I attended.

RustFest Barcelona was only the 6th edition of the conference. The first edition was [held in 2016 in Berlin](https://blog.rustfest.eu/past_events/). This makes it a relatively young conference (compared to [DrupalCon's 14 year track-record](https://www.drupal.org/association/drupalcon/locations#2005) for example). There were around 400 attendees in Barcelona.
