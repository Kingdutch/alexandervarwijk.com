RustFest Barcelona 2019 was the first time I attended a Rust conference. I've previously been to a few editions of DrupalCon as well as React.Amsterdam so I have something to compare the experience with. However, RustFest was a unique experience compared to the previous conferences I attended.

RustFest Barcelona was only the 6th edition of the conference. The first edition was [held in 2016 in Berlin](https://blog.rustfest.eu/past_events/). This makes it a relatively young conference (compared to [DrupalCon's 14 year track-record](https://www.drupal.org/association/drupalcon/locations#2005) for example). There were around 400 attendees in Barcelona. This made for enough people to be able to meet new people in every coffee or lunch break and yet was not too big to find a friendly face.

## Why Rust?

If you're already convinced that Rust is your systems programming language of choice then it's safe to skip this section. However, whenever I talk about Rust this is one of the first questions I'm asked, so it's worth addressing.
