This is a very interesting blog post that makes the case for utility-first CSS over other things like CSS-in-JS using Styled Components or Emotion. It addresses all the objections that I had about utility-first CSS including those that I came up with while reading the description on what it actually is. I'm seriously considering utility-first CSS as a solution for my next front-end project.
