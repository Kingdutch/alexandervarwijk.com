Most people in the GraphQL Galaxy are familiar with JavaScript tools when 
creating GraphQL servers. But what do you do if your team’s speciality is PHP 
and you have all your existing data available in a Drupal based platform? In 
this session I’ll take you on a tour of the tools we used to build a PHP based 
service that handles GraphQL subscriptions powering Open Social’s Real-Time 
chat, and how you can use our learnings for your own project.
