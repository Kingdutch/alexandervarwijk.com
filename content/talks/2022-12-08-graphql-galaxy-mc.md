GraphQL Galaxy is "The biggest GraphQL Conference in the cloud". The conference featured two tracks (Andromeda and Milky Way).
The Andromeda track was live all day on December 8th featuring pre-recorded talks with live Q&A. The Milky Way track was pre-recorded
with pre-recorded intro's and outro's from the MC. As part of the MC team I pre-recorded intro's and outro's for all the talks on the Milky Way
track and was part of the live opening and closing ceremony on the Andromeda track.

On December 9th the program consisted of four video discussions of which I moderated one as MC, on the topic of GraphQL security,
and led another as speaker, on the topic of GraphQL clients.
