What if Drupal could be used to power real-time applications? How could we improve the user
experience by spending less time waiting and doing more at the same time? What happens if we combine
Drupal's site-building and content authoring tools with the ability to serve persistent connections
and push data to users effortlessly.

Real-time task processing for the web has long been the domain of Node.js applications which 
are capable of juggling multiple tasks at the same time while serving persistent connections. 
However, with Fibers, modern PHP has added tools that make it possible for us to do the same inside
of Drupal.

In this talk I'll explore why the shift to asynchronous processing is a big deal and what it means
for product owners and developers alike. Discover how Drupal is slowly re-inventing itself from a
traditional synchronous web-framework into an asynchronous powerhouse.
