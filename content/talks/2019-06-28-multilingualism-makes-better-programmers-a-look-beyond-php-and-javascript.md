One of Drupal 8's leading goals was to "get off the island". We've made huge strides in adopting PHP standards and including other libraries to replace custom built solutions. However, in the day-to-day live of a Drupal developer we only touch one or two programming languages. In my talk I want to continue our journey of leaving the island by showing interesting developments of other programming languages and how we can use what they've come up with in our own use of PHP and JavaScript.
