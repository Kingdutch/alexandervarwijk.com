I'm a Full Stack developer that learned to program using Perl over 15
years ago. Since then I've explored many languages but found my focus
in the world of web development.
            
I'm currently working at 
<a href="https://www.getopensocial.com" title="Open Social - Online community software">
Open social</a>. As part of my work I've created reusable extensions for 
Enterprise customers and I've been responsible for introducing React into the 
Open Social codebase. I love looking for ways to improve accessibility, 
performance and maintainabiltity of the code I work with, preferring to build 
reusable lasting solutions over hacks.
